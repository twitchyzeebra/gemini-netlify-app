# Getting Started with AI Cognition Protocol

Welcome to the AI Cognition Protocol! This guide will help you understand how to use this application effectively and get the most out of your interactions with the AI.

## What is AI Cognition Protocol?

This application is designed to explore how AI systems "think" and process information. It provides:

1. A chat interface powered by Google's Gemini AI
2. Multiple system prompts that guide the AI's behavior
3. Learning resources about AI cognition concepts
4. A platform for experimentation and education

## Using the Interface

### Chat Panel

The main chat panel is where you interact with the AI:

- Type your message in the input box at the bottom
- The AI's responses appear above with markdown formatting
- You can collapse the chat panel using the button in the header
- Start a new chat with the "New Chat" button in the sidebar

### System Prompts

System prompts are special instructions that guide how the AI responds:

1. Click on "System Prompts" in the sidebar
2. Select a system prompt from the list
3. The AI will now follow those instructions in its responses

Different prompts produce different behaviors, allowing you to explore various cognitive patterns.

### Learning Resources

The learning resources section provides educational content:

1. Click on "Learning Resources" in the sidebar
2. Browse the available topics
3. Click on a resource to view its content in the right panel

These resources explain concepts about AI cognition, prompt engineering, and related topics.

### State Management

The application remembers your state between sessions:

- Chat history is preserved when you return
- Panel states (open/closed) are remembered
- Selected system prompt remains active
- If you encounter issues, use the reset button in the sidebar footer

## Example Use Cases

### Exploring Relational Reasoning

1. Select the "system-prompt-relational-cognition" system prompt
2. Ask questions that require connecting multiple concepts
3. Observe how the AI builds relationships between ideas

### Understanding AI Limitations

1. Try asking deliberately ambiguous questions
2. See how the AI handles uncertainty
3. Compare responses with different system prompts

### Learning About AI Concepts

1. Browse the learning resources
2. Apply concepts from the resources in your conversations
3. See how theory translates to practical interactions

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be specific** in your questions for more focused responses
2. **Experiment** with different system prompts to compare approaches
3. **Read the learning resources** to understand the theoretical background
4. **Use the reset button** if you encounter strange behavior
5. **Start new chats** when switching topics for clearer context

## Next Steps

After getting familiar with the basics:

1. Explore the more advanced learning resources
2. Try creating complex reasoning chains with the AI
3. Compare different cognitive approaches by switching system prompts
4. Consider how these interactions could apply to your own AI projects

Remember that this is both a functional tool and an educational platform. The goal is not just to get answers, but to understand how AI cognition works and how it can be directed through different prompting strategies.
