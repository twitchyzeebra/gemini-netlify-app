# Learning Resources Index

This document serves as an index to the learning resources available in the AI Cognition Protocol project. Resources are categorized by topic for easier navigation.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started with AI Cognition Protocol](./GettingStarted.md) - Introduction to using the application and understanding its features.

## AI Cognition Concepts

- [Relational Cognition Chain of Thought](./RelationalCognitionCot.md) - Explores how AI systems can build relational understanding through step-by-step reasoning.
- [Emotional Simulation](./EmotionalSimulation.md) - Discussion on how AI systems simulate emotional understanding.
- [Thoughts Of AI](./Thoughts%20Of%20AI.md) - Philosophical perspectives on AI cognition patterns.

## Practical Applications

- [How AI can help humanity](./How%20AI%20can%20help%20humanity.md) - Overview of positive applications of AI technologies.
- [What Can I Use This Chat For](./What%20Can%20I%20Use%20This%20Chat%20For.md) - Guide for users on effective ways to utilize the chat interface.

## AI Interaction Guidelines

- [Dealing With Bossy Interactions](./BossyDealingWith.md) - Tips for handling directive or demanding conversational patterns.

## Adding New Resources

To add a new learning resource:

1. Create a Markdown file in the `learning-resources/` directory
2. Use a descriptive filename that reflects the content
3. Add the resource to this index under the appropriate category
4. The resource will automatically appear in the UI sidebar
